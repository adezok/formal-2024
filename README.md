# Formalising Mathematics in Lean

This is the repository for the GlaMS course on Formalising Mathematics in Lean. The course content (workshop sheets and homeworks) is located in the folder `ForMaL`,  which also contains some references we are using.

You can clone this repository to your own computer to work on things, if you already have lean installed. Or you can use codespaces by choosing the codespaces tab under the top right code menu, to try using lean in your web browser.
